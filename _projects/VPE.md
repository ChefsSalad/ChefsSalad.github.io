#### üèÜ **Competition & Recognition**

This project achieved **1st place** in the AI medical image segmentation track co-organized by **Shanghai AI Laboratory** and **Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine**.  
It was subsequently invited for presentation at the **2023 Healthy China Sinan Summit** and the **Frontiers of Digital Medicine Forum**.

#### üß† **Project Overview**

This project introduces a novel **Visual Perception-Enhanced Segmentation (VPES)** framework designed for lightweight and accurate medical image segmentation.  
It focuses on preprocessing, slice-wise attention, and collaborative dual-branch perception to enhance robustness and precision.

#### üîß **Contributions Overview**

##### 1. üßº **Effective Data Preprocessing**

This method analyzes the Hounsfield Unit (HU) distribution from a colorectal tumor CT dataset and designs a two-step preprocessing pipeline:

- **HU-based intensity truncation**
- **Noise cropping using object detection**

##### 2. üß† **Lightweight 2.5D Slice-Wise Attention**

We propose a 2.5D data structure where adjacent slices are stacked as channels.  
A slice-wise attention module dynamically reweights each channel to focus on informative regions.

##### 3. üß© **Enhanced Visual Perception Module**

We design a **dual-branch co-attention mechanism** to fuse global context and multi-scale local texture features, enabling strong segmentation under complex conditions.

#### üßÆ **Mathematical Notations**

##### Hounsfield Unit (HU):

$$
HU = 1000 \times \frac{\mu - \mu_{water}}{\mu_{water}}
$$

Where:
- $\mu$: Attenuation coefficient of tissue  
- $\mu_{water}$: Attenuation coefficient of water

##### Normalization:

$$
x_{norm} = \frac{clip(x, HU_{min}, HU_{max}) - HU_{min}}{HU_{max} - HU_{min}}
$$

Where $HU_{min}$ and $HU_{max}$ are clipped based on the 0.05% percentile tails.
