#### **üß† Motivation & Core Idea**

Financial factor systems are inherently complex, diverse, and noisy. These signals exhibit vastly different efficacy and stability across various market regimes and time scales. Traditional methods often employ a "one-size-fits-all" approach, attempting to capture all data states with a single, complex model. This limits their ability to adapt to local structures, often failing to capture nuanced details while struggling with robust generalization.

Inspired by the **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** strategy, widely successful in Large Language Models, we propose a multi-agent system. This approach enables sparse computation and effective model scaling, allowing individual agents to focus on specific local signals for enhanced representation, and collaborate efficiently through an adaptive, collective modeling strategy.

#### **üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture**

Our multi-agent system is composed of a group of heterogeneous models. For example, a momentum factor group might include distinct agents specializing in short, medium, and long-term trend signals respectively. As illustrated in our MAA structure, we feed signals with different characteristics‚Äîsuch as short-term volatility alongside medium and long-term trends‚Äîinto different generators (agents). These specialized agents then work in synergy to form a comprehensive forecast.

#### **üìä Experimental Results**

#### **‚úÖ Quantitative Investment Backtesting**

The framework's specialized, adaptive design translates into strong empirical performance. Backtesting across 12 different commodity futures shows that MAA-TSF consistently outperforms other baseline models in generating cumulative returns, demonstrating its practical value in financial markets.

#### **üìà Model-Driven Trading Decisions**

The framework provides a complete, interpretable decision-making process with clear buy and sell signals. The visualization below illustrates the model's actions, the resulting equity curve, and the net profit generated during a specific trading period.
