#### **üèÜ Honors & Recognition**

Received **National 6th Place** in the *China College Student Computer Design Competition (4C)*  
and **First Prize** in the *Shanghai Collegiate Application Technology Competition (Enterprise Cooperation Track)*.

---

#### **üß† Motivation & Core Idea**

This project develops an **AI-powered educational data analysis and dialogue system** that integrates **large language models**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **big data frameworks** to enhance educational resource management and classroom intelligence.

It enables efficient natural language interaction with educational databases, automatic classroom transcript generation, and reliable AI-assisted analysis.

#### **üß© System Components**

1. **Text2SQL for Natural Language Data Querying**  
   * A **Text2SQL large model** converts user natural language queries into structured SQL statements.  
   * Queries are executed via automated scripts, returning results as **interactive visualization charts**.  
   * Few-shot prompting ensures logical completion and prompt engineering safeguards output reliability.

---

2. **RAG-based Classroom Knowledge Retrieval**  
   * Extracts **audio streams from teaching videos** and transcribes them using **OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper** model.  
   * Builds a **vectorized classroom knowledge base** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
   * The system retrieves relevant segments, returns the **source paragraphs as references**,  
     and uses a secondary model to **validate relevance**, mitigating model hallucinations and improving reliability.

---

3. **ChatGLM3-6B Assistant Integration**  
   * Fine-tuned and deployed **ChatGLM3-6B** as a conversational assistant for teachers and students.  
   * Supports multi-turn, context-aware question answering and resource recommendations.

---

4. **Big Data Infrastructure (Hadoop + Spark)**  
   * Utilizes **Hadoop** and **Apache Spark** for large-scale educational data processing, aggregation, and real-time analytics.  
   * Enhances institutional **resource allocation**, **performance monitoring**, and **decision-making efficiency**.
